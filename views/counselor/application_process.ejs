            <h3>How the Application Process Works</h3>
            <p>Our application process is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Here's what you need to know about
                the
                application:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Basic Information:</strong> We'll start by asking for some basic details, like your name,
                    contact
                    information, university, major, and any extracurricular activities you're involved in.</li>
                <li><strong>College Essays:</strong> Share any college admission essays you've written or similar pieces
                    that
                    demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively. This helps us understand your writing style and
                    communication skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Proof of Identity:</strong> To ensure authenticity, we'll need a valid proof of
                    identification, such as
                    your university ID or driver's license.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How We Select Mentors</h3>
            <p>Once you submit your application, our team will review it thoroughly. We'll look at your academic

                process.</p>
            <p>If you're selected, we'll reach out to you for an interview. This is a chance for us to get to know you
